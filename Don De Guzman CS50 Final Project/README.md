#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/eRWqgnLATec>
#### Description: 

##### "THE VERY EASY GAMING PC GUIDE!" is a quick guide that will help and motivate beginner PC builders to start building their own PC. The website is divided into 4 parts; Home, Main Parts, Necessities and Cool stuff and also a German version of the website. It is executed using Web-Based HTML, [Javascript](script.js)(For Popups and Alerts) and [CSS](styles.css)(for Aesthetics) with the help of [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and other cited guides

##### **Top Navigation Bar and Buttons**

##### I'd like to start 1st with my top navigation bar because it exists in every html. It "activates" the current address name of the current html as a visual aid to help the users where they are. Its responses during a user's hover action will lower the text and change the colouring. 

##### Lastly it has a working German version link button that sends the user to the German version of the webpage. It directly sends the user to the same part of the website for example if the user is in [MAIN PARTS](main_parts.html) then they will be sent to [HAUPTTEILE](main_parts_de.html). Every html that has an "_de" at the ending are the German versions of the webpage

##### **Colour Scheme**

##### I took inspiration from [_Cyberpunk 2077_](https://www.cyberpunk.net/ph/en/)'s colour scheme because it fits the vibe of being a games, plus it just looks eye catching and edgy.

##### **[home.html](home.html)**

##### This html welcomes the user with a huge picture of literal toddlers to make them feel how easy it is to build a PC, which it is.

##### I put my name below and a quick information about what to expect from this guide and a "Did you know". I wrote a working _bookmark_ which immediately sends the user to their chosen build end which are High-End, Mid-End and Low-End. All of High-End, Mid-End and Low-End parts are coded the same. 

##### I divided each of them and centered a huge video gameplay muted for each respective end with a Text link underneath directing the user to the game's steam page because it looks cool while they browse my site. These divisions contain PROS and CONS with hoverable words  and a working button that reveal video games recommendations for each _-end_. If they click one of the recommended video games their genre will appear using a _Javascript_.

##### Below are the useful links which are the _downloadable checklist_ for the user's convenience and a link to [pcpartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/) where the user can quote their chosen parts

##### **[main_parts.html](main_parts.html)**

##### This one contains information about the main parts of a builder's PC and recommended parts to buy for every end of the builder's choice. I sorted and organized every main part in a numerical fashion with brief infos and where they connect about each of them and recommendations to buy below. I made the collapse buttons hoverable for aesthetic purposes. When you hover the main parts button it changes the colours and when you hover the recommended parts buttons they light up. These recommended parts are displayed using tables to represent each High-End, Mid-End and Low-End choices. They are clickable and the user will be sent to an _Amazon_ link of the clicked part.

##### Below I cited down the sources of the information I gathered and helped me. The sources button is also collapsable

##### ***The code for this html are the base code for the following htmls***

##### **[necessities.html](necessities.html)**

##### It contains all of the information of the necessary parts to support a working PC. I linked 1 and more youtube videos for some recommended parts because there's just too many good choices and I like to try something different. I linked a text to [COOL STUFF](cool_stuff.html) for PC builders interested on making their PC look cool

##### **[maintenance.html](maintenance.html)**

##### This contains a brief guide on how to maintain your PC alive. Before the user begins looking after their PC I put on a clickable alert button using Javascript.

##### This time it contains application guide which isn't usually obvious when these are bought. 

##### Pro Tips are collapsible buttons because there's just too many for me to say.

##### **[cool_stuff.html](cool_stuff.html)**

##### The most simple out of all of my htmls because it's optional. It contains a gaming keyboard, gaming mouse, microphones and webcams. Each with their own recommendations in a playable video.
